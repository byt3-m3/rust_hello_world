/* 
Primitive Types
Integers: u8, i8, u16, i16, u32, i32, u64, i64, u128, i128 (Number of bits they take in memory) - unsigned means no negative values
Floats: f32, f64
Boolean: (bool)
Characters: (char)
Tuples
Array - Fixed length, vectors are dynamic length

Rust is statitcally typed, but its not required to set the type during variable definition, the complier can infer the type based on the value
